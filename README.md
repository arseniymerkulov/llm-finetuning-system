#### LLM Finetuning system 
This repository contains code of my research in the NLP+AutoML field. The application is an automated system for supervised finetuning of language models that is using meta data of various LLM finetuning expirements to predict parameters values during HPO.

1. Launch system with ```flask run```
2. Execute finetuning scenarios with ```pytest tests/<scenario_name>.py```
